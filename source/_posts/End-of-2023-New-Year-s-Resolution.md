Hey guys, sorry for not updating in a while, just couldn't really find the time or put in the effort to type a new blog TMT

Well uh I'll talk about ICPC first.

Unfortunately, we got 3rd place in regionals, but because first place was also from our school, we couldn't qualify for NAC.

Not gonna lie, its kind of my fault that I'm way too weak compared to my teammates, they definitely deserve to get in NAC, and I kind of pulled them back. Sorry Boying, I wasted your last chance in ICPC.

After that I kind of shifted my focus to other things, and only started doing contests again recently, although I'm not doing really well in terms of performance, losing rating 7 rounds in a row. It's honestly pretty heart breaking but I also think this is not a bad thing, because I can really focus on experiencing the contests and making myself stronger, compared to skipping contests because of being afraid to lose rating.

In terms of academics, I am actually doing quite well. I finished the first semester with all A's quite easily and qualified for dean's list. I felt that my course load was really light this sememster though, so I will make it more challenging next semester. I also kind of want to double major in math, which is mindblowing if you told this to me half a year ago, as I am horrible at math and was literally rejected by every college because of it. But I actually find it quite interesting now when the problems aren't just trick math, and I think that math is very important so I should try my best to learn more. I'm self-studying calc 2 and 3 in this winter break now in hopes to skip them when the semester starts, we will see how it goes ;)

I also attended by first hackathonâ€”MadHacks. It was an interesting experience, and I got alot of different t-shirts and accessories.

Its a very excruciating experience though, I didn't sleep for like 30 hours and it was super exhausting, we didn't even wait till the ceremony and I went back to sleep. It turned out that we actually won a google backpack and it is pretty nice!

2023 Was a really interesting year, I initally was really sad that I didn't get into prestigous schools like Cornell or UIUC, but after this semester, I'm actually quite glad that I went to UW Madison and met so many wonderful people!

OK, now for my new year's resolution:

1. Maintain 4.0 GPA
2. Double Major in CS + MATH
3. Doing at least 5 problems everyday on CF
4. CF Master (or at least CM)
5. Qualify for NAC
6. Get Research
7. Get Internship

I hope 2024 will be a great year, and that I can have an epic comeback and become a better person than before!

Happy new year :D
