Time flies! It's already been one month since I came to the US. Things are going pretty smooth except that im too introverted to make friends in my dorm floor. But no worries! I still have a couple of friends and I plan to make more!
Now lets give an update to various aspects of my life:

### Research

This is one of the more unfortunate things. Skunkworks forgot to put me in the list in summer, and all researches were already full. I was pretty disappointed not gonna lie, but this also gave me a chance to focus 100% on CP, so maybe not the worst thing that could happen!

### Academics

I currently have 6 classes: MUSIC 113, CS 300, CS 252, LIS 202, PHYSICS 107, ART 100.
MUSIC 113 is pretty free with basically no workload so it's fine.
CS 300 is pretty doable apart from multiple choices (I don't know java), but A is still managable.
CS 252 is the one I am more worried about, 4 exams in total and getting A is kinda tight, but 44% got A before so I think I could get A with a bit studying.
LIS 202 is pretty free too apart from a few writings and readings.
PHYSICS 107 is also free. No homework no tests only a few writings.
ART 100 has a heavy workload, but if you do them all you can get an easy A.

I'm actually starting to feel the pressure now, because I have alot of things that have a pretty close due date, but I also want to train CP!

### CP

My teammates for ICPC are quite promising, including one IOI guy (although he didn't do cp in college afterwards till now), and one that got into NAC last year.
Our main enemys are Sepled's team and mewnian's vietnam team. I'm not sure if we are capable of defeating them as they are really strong but I will certainly try my best.

I've done 2 contests during September (till now), and I got +134 rating in total. I did really well in round 897, solving A,B,C,E1,E2 and got ranked in sub-400, very cool! In contrast, I only solved A,B,C in 899 unfortunately, though I was fast enough to still get +10 rating. It seems that im not really good with rerooting dp (or dp in general haha), so I might need to work on that...

I have made some goals for my freshman year, we will see if I success or not!

1. CF Master rank in freshman year
2. ICPC Regional Gold
3. 4.0 GPA freshman year

Also, congrats for my friend lemonilemon for getting rank 108 and reaching CM, hope I can get to CM soon!
