Okay its actually already been almost 11 days since I got to the US, and like around a week since I moved in to my dorm.
I'm starting to get used to the life here, and well I miss Taiwan very much. People here are all pretty friendly although a bit too chaotic haha.
I currently live in Chadbourne resident hall, which is a pretty nice dorm with an awesome location!
I can physically feel the temperature getting colder and colder each day, and it's only september now! I wonder how cold it would go...
I did the calculus 1 skip test a few days ago. I think im going to pass the test because it wasn't really hard. I'm thinking of skipping all three calculus classes by self-studying, I wonder if I can pull it off or not (I hope so).
The food here is kinda hit or miss. There is an buffet kind of cafeteria just under Chadbourne, so its quite convenient to get food here! The pizzas are always pretty consistent, but other things are more based on luck to be honest.
Also, doing classes with 400 other students is a pretty exciting experience! though most of the chairs and desks suck here >:(
Currently, my course schedule is made so I can do every codeforces contest (my first class will be at 1:30 pm). Even if there isn't a contest I can sleep to my hearts content! great schedule!
Although, doing cf contests in the morning when your brain hasn't started yet isn't the best experience. I tried out a div 3 contest and things went horribly wrong.
There is div 2s back to back tomorrow, and I will attend both of them. I don't wish I maintain my rating, I just wish I can preform and do my best.
I've also met alot of new people here, although I'm struggling to make friends in my dorm floor (im just too introverted and I was sick the second day I got here haha), I made some comp sci friends and some people I met while waiting for things, cool!

Anyways, things seem to be pretty good the first week im here. I'll try my best at socialing, studying and doing cp. good luck myself and on Wisconsin~
