I've discovered alot of great songs that I enjoyed, some I thought to share some here.

### [月詠み『逆転劇』](https://youtu.be/I4hKvP2jS1g?si=cGR2crTBlCnPFp1V)

This one I replayed over and over these couple of days. It really makes feel feel powerful, and gives me the feel that I shouldn't give up. The lyrics are also awesome and really inspiring.
Apparently it's from an anime, might actually check it out because of this song (I watched steins gate because of the music, and it became one of my favorites)

### [永遠の不在証明 / covered by 幸祜](https://youtu.be/PpoM9C-H0qA?si=hgn6g8nCsPkgNrQ-)

This song was from a detective conan movie that I actually went and watched. I think the original song was just "okay", but this cover really shocked me. The voice is so superb and so I also replayed over and over these days.

### [ギターと孤独と蒼い惑星 (Bocchi the Rock!)](https://youtu.be/SDk1RA4g8CA?si=993kq-74g1XplJQJ)

### [星座になれたら (Bocchi the Rock!)](https://youtu.be/rXRvs_FrwEk?si=el10Y5mwfps_KWcf)

Yes, I only watched Bocchi the Rock recently, Although I already listen to them regularly even when I haven't watched it before. Great anime go watch it (I plan to start watching anime again after this haha)!

### [魔女と旋律の街 / 可不・きりたん - Fty](https://youtu.be/xjsYfqDcHnk?si=-Hj9aH5P0Dw3csw3)

I love vocoloid, and the musics with KAFU are always really good for some reason XD.

### [偏食 covered by CIEL](https://youtu.be/Hmcf01DLepk?si=fH65J54BvoA-mv4x)

The vocal really made this song feel. I don't know how many times I've replayed it.

### [〈GODS〉](https://youtu.be/C3GouGa0noM?si=nWD6mt6u6rKfMyVw)

Ok hear me out: League world final musics are always fire. Although I don't play the game anymore, I still get hyped everytime I hear world final music, it's just so good.

### [蓋棺クリサリス / Team Grimoire feat. Sennzai](https://youtu.be/QO15ke236OQ?si=QL-UIqo5vbHU9BHA)

Sennzai is someone I just found out recently. I really like her vocals, and combined with Team Grimoire is an automatic YES for me!

### [Swelling / PSYQUI feat. Sennzai](https://youtu.be/Z5F2xJoS85M?si=-AILsGpqBjRNoWgr)

Another fire song from sennzai, combined with another favorite composer of mine, PSYQUI. Go listen to PSYQUI if you love EDM/Future Bass!

### [VICTIM / Sennzai](https://youtu.be/w2RHt3LZqVY?si=62c7wyWjJQSGbsVP)

Yes, I love Sennzai.

### [隨神之側 - feat.ミク&リン&GUMI](https://youtu.be/b2GJcYBoVyg?si=A4qyMkW0OiFqpKkl)

Another amazing vocoloid song with inspiring lyrics, really cheers me up too.

### [天国と地獄 -言ノ葉リンネ- -れるりり feat 初音ミク&GUMI](https://youtu.be/bfHcIdHsfKU?si=4uoCH7B8Lo8kgboZ)

Awesome song, enough said. I really like the chorus, choosing miku in this song was a right choice.

### [無意識レクイエム (cosmobsp rmx)](https://youtu.be/hCgAiV-MYYw?si=68eZIGfBR_IxjLI6)

Don't you just love touhou remixes with extreme horror lyrics and visuals? I do :D

### [Kotone 「Autonomy」](https://youtu.be/S3gDMAfDfgQ?si=Z_xNjmoW9B8TbDdo)

Kotone's covers are always pretty nice, but wow I never knew her original musics can be so good!

### [名前のない怪物 Covered by 花鋏キョウ](https://youtu.be/UYPJGCQU_v0?si=seLD03CA6QgUBAfm)

Really like the chorus, was the earliest song that I set on repeat along with Swelling and 偏食.

### [感傷幽霊 feat.沖石](https://youtu.be/9PuudPiyma4?si=1dX0CV9ekLwPzlfY)

This was recommended by a good friend of mine in Taiwan, awesome stuff, really enjoyed it.

### [抜錨 / ナナホシ管弦楽団 -Cover- ウォルピスカーター](https://youtu.be/k1d3E1zeVzI?si=U71oWqkFCSglvQf3)

I really like ウォルピスカーター, did you know that he is a male singer? insane high notes, perfection.

### [泥中に咲 / ウォルピスカーター](https://youtu.be/40dJS_LC6S8?si=vZ7unVYl_twsijm5)

Another one that I really, really like can listen to frequently.

Ok, I noticed that I wrote too much, and I still have a ton that I want to introduce. Maybe next time, I guess?
