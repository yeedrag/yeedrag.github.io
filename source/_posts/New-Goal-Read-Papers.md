This is honestly something I've been wanting to do in a while now. I feel like one of my biggest weaknesses is the lack of knowledge in SOTA methods. In a field where there are ground breaking researches being produced everyday, I need to be equipped with the newest knowledge at every moment.

I will probabily make like a summary each week of the papers I've read (likely 2 ~ 3 papers), and I think I will start from classical computer vision papers (YOLO, ResNet) and extremely influential papers (Transformers, GPT), then I will maybe start going into fields and papers that im interested in (Maybe like domain transfer, adversarial attacks...).

I'll roughly choose the papers in this [repo](https://github.com/aimerou/awesome-ai-papers), or even this [repo](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week) for more recent ones.

We'll see how stuff goes and change accordingly, I really hope I can learn alot more after this weekly goal!
