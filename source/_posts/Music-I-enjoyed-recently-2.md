The workload in school has ramped up quite quickly recently, so listening to music really helped me lessen my stress. I also discovered alot of great songs that I enjoy recently, so I wanted to share them here.

## Japanese

### [【初音ミク×GUMI×鏡音リン】PaⅢ.SENSATION](https://youtu.be/OMQNhcGZbX4?si=SRjlQTWukNjbnmN_)

Miku and GUMI and Rin? Sign me up!

### [まにまに / 初音ミク](https://youtu.be/9O2VyUM5MlQ?si=Emp2M_Ag822nwz9f)

I really like the part at 3:08, its just so epic and I enjoy it so much!!

### [バースデイ / 可不](https://youtu.be/mA5cl5tYHaQ?si=v93t_EK8bW9b_GEa)

Its so hard to find a bad KAFU song...

### [ロクデナシ「眼差し](https://youtu.be/J4hdiW-V5no?si=QOSZ27N2Tu5hMCBi)

A really soothing and warm song imo.

### [ピノキオピー - ノンブレス・オブリージュ feat. 初音ミク](https://youtu.be/lw7pcm1W5tw?si=Ux95vmdHuCXxstnY)

Ok yes, the only reason I know this song is because of that funny osu map.

### [Myuk - 愛の唄](https://youtu.be/go6iydhxbW0?si=JN-NRX5gkV0X61XU)

I basically listened to this non-stop while I was on the plane back to the US.

### [夜明けの歌 (feat. DAZBEE)](https://youtu.be/CTdggeWFUHA?si=nb5Qwwm6eqpIK-3c)

I really like M2U, and this made me fell in love with DAZBEE too.

### [Marigold (feat. Guriri)](https://youtu.be/hqB9_UgzJ5A?si=xKMzE8tMnu6QY8l8)

I mean well, if you know M2U you should know marigold already, but I still put it in here because its just SO good.

### [DAZBEE (ダズビー) | ‘イビツナコトバ’](https://youtu.be/f09oTPk4hTY?si=Og00KHUVamJyXq-c)

DAZBEE rocks im telling you!

### [Kano - スキスキ絶頂症](https://youtu.be/wJ3qE4PNdbs?si=xAOCr_wQg49Ii-HK)

This is also a really classic song from OSU, and Kano is such a goat with a awesome voice line. I really like her vocal!

### [緑黄色社会 - Mela!](https://youtu.be/wzslO9QbDAQ?si=vgQKsQNli8pxYMI3)

Mela Mela! I probabily repeated this song the most times out off all the songs here...

### [緑黄色社会- Shout Baby](https://youtu.be/YOnqT1xVTM0?si=6mVKdoO_qSR3nRCq)

Another super banger music from the same band :D

### [緑黄色社会 - 花になって](https://youtu.be/voAu0YRWUNE?si=tZDLOVlqwxD5h8TB)

I think this is the OP for a recent anime, and was discussed quite often to not match the tone of the anime (along with 勇者 for frieren), but they both are bangers so who cares :D

### [ユイカ - Seventeen's Song](https://youtu.be/9C178An_B_I?si=rBPn6HrRt8-yGk3M)

Really cute, really like :D

### [Empty old City - Chronicle A](https://youtu.be/cND2-LfD62w?si=EBrFgH0Up7JnJw3h)

Idk how I found this, but I do not regret a bit, really catchy!

### [EGOIST『絶体絶命』](https://youtu.be/DR5FSueiJxI?si=fa0U9TcXszF_B_7P)

Man, EGOIST really knows how to make bangers, I also replayed this over and over, and I was shocked to find out this was made for a mobile game...

### [EGOIST - 最後の花弁](https://youtu.be/zj9OiizX3t8?si=couZESZeGbTtMM5H)

Its EGOIST, go listen to it NOW!

### [毒々 / covered by 幸祜](https://youtu.be/Ylq9EvCvB5c?si=k1FmEGuHcmlsI4xK)

Awesome cover from KOKO as always.

### [ELFENSJóN - 星屑の輪廻](https://youtu.be/65etqlBdI5k?si=4XVt5FJBOn6AWNRe)

Awesome male vocal, really enjoyed!

### [ELFENSJóN『暁を葬れば』](https://youtu.be/cBA9nkoCPs4?si=sMPWl640gS1CBeQg)

Awesome female vocal, really enjoyed! :D

### [すいそうぐらし- 大人なふりして](https://youtu.be/Q_nUpKfXepA?si=Ksfm88erJyRTknJs)

I somehow just found out this song yesterday, but lemme tell you, I am ADDICTED, its so good TMT

### [女王蜂 - Mephisto](https://youtu.be/dLlD-dZNACM?si=ud8Of0E7AUIvPawZ)

I'm really curious in the sexuality of the vocal in this band, they have an insane vocal and I love it.

### [椎名もた(siinamota)/ 少女A](https://youtu.be/AqI97zHMoQw?si=eGvbh_lzqhgNr0Br)

This song deserves a special place in my heart.

## Korean

### [약속지가 (feat. Sherie)](https://youtu.be/NxFLl23XtY8?si=wp7xAiUfm3a-InnE)

Its from M2U, ofc its a FUCKING BANGER AAAAA

### [IVE 아이브 'I AM'](https://youtu.be/6ZUIwj3FgUY?si=iW4LcnEPFJSetjZS)

This song is way too addicting, even as someone who doesn't particularly enjoy KPOP, im still addicted to it haha.

### [SEVENTEEN (세븐틴) '손오공'](https://youtu.be/-GQg25oP0S4?si=DpqVDgHW4gho4ezR)

Does listening to this song make me gay? ngl korean boys really do know how do be sexy asf TMT

## Chinese

### [南西肯恩 NeciKen〈我也曾經想過這樣殺了我自己 Once I Thought of Leaving〉](https://youtu.be/aT6056Eb11I?si=n3McR-FVQyPQJpv9)

Quite a depressing song, when I'm feeling down I really like listening to this.

### [南西肯恩 NeciKen〈大海 Ocean〉](https://youtu.be/exVEN7hlqBg?si=0bapuyGw5ASqT3Uh)

Also a depressing song, but its so good...

### [Hello Nico〈花〉](https://youtu.be/BlblBvpVgjE?si=fDEMM3O18n7ih-Jt)

Guess what? its also depressing hahaha, I guess indie bands love being depressed...

### [VH - 複寫 (More)](https://youtu.be/RZOZ8GRJL-Y?si=ax7Mi6cCRFsheQc5)

This guitar made me had an orgasm...

## Others

### [EigHt Novel - 輪廻転生](https://youtu.be/vuEYQsiaNeA?si=Z_Sh5atKUuOZkYlO)

Criminally underrated, this should have 100x more views wtf

### [goreshit - Bad Habits](https://youtu.be/og7S-j4Ls7k?si=GYinV5m8T4gUqt7S)

I remember seeing a [meme](https://youtu.be/OGXJiJbxmWo?si=F-4ugPY6Z8muDaiu) about breakcore, its so fucking funny that its true lmaoooo

### [goreshit - Toromi Hearts 2](https://youtu.be/pk5F3q5UiWQ?si=aOvxEM4iiOIJNPds)

Self explainatory.

### [Undefeatable (feat. Kellin Quinn)](https://youtu.be/u_FRDqHT5y0?si=3JSglr1wmMW7K54r)

So uh, why does music from Sonic slap so hard TMT

### [Radiant](https://youtu.be/eImNc6AIViQ?si=FAHpisBue5PVdELW)

Another example of mobile game music being way too good.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I did not expect this to be so long. I included some music in other languages because people actually asked me about my interests in chinese musics and others. I still have so many music I want to put in here but its getting absurdly long, so maybe next time!

edit: ok wait fuck I need to add this one, I just found it out after writing it, and its so fucking amazing

### [tn-shi - Synthesis](https://youtu.be/dOP7G5J755s?si=xut-FttlCGh8I-of)

One of the craziest, creative visuals, baller music, holy fucking shit this is amazing god!!!
